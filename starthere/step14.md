# Step 14

Once the below fields are available, take the information you took down from step 5, and input them into the corresponding fields.

-IP Address  
-Subnet mask  
-Default Gateway

Now, this is where you can decide exactly what you'd like to assign your IP address as.

If you'd like to keep the current IP from changing with DHCP, simply keep all of the fields you filled in the same.  

Essentially, this is preventing your computer from assigning another IP address when you're connected to this network.

Optionally, you can adjust the first field (IP Address) to another appropriate address.  
>This doesn't mean any numbers, however.

To ensure no issues arise after setting a custom IP, make sure you only adjust the last 3 digits of your IP address. (2-255).  

Also ensure that no other machines are using the address you assigned. This is called an IP conflict, and will cause issues!
